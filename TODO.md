# foponts project TODO list

Here is a list of todo items that nice to add to the current foponts project:

- [ ] Include Windows-specific information on installing foponts on Windows based machines.
- [ ] Add an MD5sums to all downloaded artifacts and add appropriate info in [README](README.md).
- [ ] Add a troubleshooting section in [README](README.md) file.
- [ ] Add a fonts mapping logic diagram, explaining how foponts maps fonts/glyphs on the way xsl:fo > fo > pdf and why it is always better to use font families in xsl:fo rather than certain fonts names/glyphs.
- [ ] Add small text file within the downloaded archive to point to the current project on github.
